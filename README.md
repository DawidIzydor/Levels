**How to use:**

* Tiles: You can set the elevation range of a tile through the overhead tile config. The tile must be Overehead and must have a Better Roofs mode other than "None" enabled (set occlusion to Fade for best results). **Range for actual roofs must be set to bottom,infinity (eg. 20,infnity)**

* Drawings: to create a hole (for example a balcony) create a POLYGON or RECTANGLE, then set the range for the hole in the drawing config and set the levels mode as hole
            to create a stair do the same but set the levels mode as stair, a stair will toggle between the bottom elevation and the top elevation + 1

* Lights: You can set the elevation range of a light through the light config, set it as a range like 5,15 for example

* Walls: The building needs to be walled for better roof to understand where the building is (you can enable building preview in better roofs module settings to check that it's calculated correctly)

**UI**

You can use the levels's ui to make things easier for you, just select the levels layer from the left side buttons and define your levels - with the widget you can then navigate the levels, anything you place (related to levels) when a level is selected will be automatically setup with the chosen top and bottom

**Elevation**

Your tokens will change levels by changing their elevation, you can also setup zones with drawings

# **API**

**Get the ceiling\floor of one or multiple tokens**

```js
  /**
   * Get the floor and ceiling of one or multiple tokens.
   * @param {Object|Object[]|String|String[]} tokenIds - A Token, an Array of Tokens, a Token ID or an Array of Tokens IDs
   * @returns {Object|Object[]} - returns an object containing token as the token object and range as an Array with 0 = Floor 1 = Ceiling
  **/

  _levels.getTokens(tokenIds)
```

**Patched canvas.walls.checkCollision method to check against a specific elevation**

```js
  checkCollision(ray, options, elevation) â†’ {boolean}
```
