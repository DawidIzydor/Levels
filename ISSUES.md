# Before Opening an issue:
(This document is stored in the Levels repository but it's valid for all my repos)

This is not to discurage bug reports or feature requests, it's for my own organization and faster troubleshooting and bug fixes (Keeping track of 40ish modules is not easy, please be understanding :) ).

## Discord
You can join the discord here: https://theripper93.com/

## Help/Troubleshooting

If you have issues setting up one of my modules or using one or more of it's features use the `#troubleshooting-help` discord channel, help/setup request in the github issues will be ignored and closed.

## Feature requests/Enhancements
Post your feature request on discord, the issue traker here is just used to track bugs.
If you post a feature request it will be automatically closed.
Use the `#feature-requests-public` channel or the higher priority `#feature-requests` channel (if you are a Patreon)

## Bugs:
You can post bugs in the issues of the repo or on the discord. Generally the discord is preferred since it allows for faster interactions and troubleshooting.
Whether you are posting the issue here or on discord follow the bug report template or your issue will be closed.
If you have clear steps to reproduce the issue report the bug `in the github issues` or in the `#bug-report` channel on discord.
If you don't have clear steps to reproduce use the `#troubleshooting` discord channel instead

## Before Reporting:

* Make sure the issue happens with only the module in question (plus it's dependencies if any)
* Check the module repository for known or alredy fixed issues in future versions (this is located in the readme of the repo if present)
* Check the module readme - your issue might be a common issue with provided workaround or the readme might contain steps to solve your issue.
* Try to isolate the issue as much as possible (try to reproduce it on a new scene with minimal amount of factors)
* Provide a list of steps to take to reproduce the issue
* Once you have this informations use the `Bug Report Template`

```
NOTE: Many of my modules rely on the Game Canvas, if you are using FoundryVTT with Game Canvas Disabled or with no active scene, you might encounter errors.
You can ignore these errors, no fixes will be provided for error tiggered by a disabled game canvas or no active scene.
